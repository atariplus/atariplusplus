Compilation of Atari++ for win32 platforms:
Starting with Atari++, win32 is a possible target platform
for the emulator. You need to provide the following for
using Atari++:

o) ROM images, as for all other platforms.
o) The SDL library. Copy the sdl.dll file into the directory
containing the atari++ emulator binary.

For compiling,
o) the includes and libraries for SDL 1.2.5 or better.
o) Visual Studio C++ 7.1 (part of .NET 2003) or better.


Steps for compiling Atari++ on win32:
o) extract the archive (e.g. with WinZip),
o) rename wintypes.h to types.h. This file contains
specific adaptions for the target compiler.
o) Start Visual Studio C++ 7.1
o) Open the "atari++.vcproj" file; this contains the
atari++ project settings for the compiler.
o) Possibly modify the include and library paths for
the SDL library. For once, SDL2/SDL.h must be in the
include path (preprocessor settings) and sdl.lib must be
linked to the binary.
o) Let the compiler go.
o) Have fun!


Restrictions of the win32 port
==============================

o) no PNG screen snapshots. Only PNM and BMP.
o) no zlib support for compressed images/files.
o) The Atari++ native file system interface, the H: handler,
does not support locking/unlocking of files.
